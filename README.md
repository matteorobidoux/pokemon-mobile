## Description
Developed our own version of Pokemon to deploy on Android. Our version focuses primarily on the capturing and battle aspects of the game. We used data curated at https://pokeapi.co/ as the basis for our game. We then stored this data to a database and use the database in our final implementation.

## Instructions for running
We have music playing, so please have your volume on!
* Note the music works with recent APIs and may not work on a version older than API 22
